<h1>Project:- Student performance prediction</h1>

This project focuses on predicting students' performance in Maths subject using machine learning models. It leverages a dataset containing comprehensive information about students, including gender,race_ethnicity,parental_level_of_education,lunch,test_preparation_course,math_score,reading_score,writing_score. The goal is to develop and evaluate several machine learning algorithms to predict students' score in maths subject.
